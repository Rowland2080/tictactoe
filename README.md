This is a game of TICTACTOE, which can be played on the CLI.
It's basically a two player game whereby two players take turns placing specially assigned tokens on a 3 x 3 grid board.
The game ends when a player has won or it's a draw.
The game is won when one player is able to occupy all three cells in a row or column or either of the two diagonals.
If the board is full and the game hasn't been won by either of the two players, then it is ruled as a draw.
